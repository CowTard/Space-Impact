      * Import the project and run th program.

  * Console:
      ```sh
        $ cd ../your/destination_folder
        $ python<3> main.py
      ```
  
###Requirements list:

*   Python 3.4
  * [Download Python!](https://www.python.org/)

*   Pygame
  * [Download pygame!](http://pygame.org/)

**As a side note, "Fun" while playing this game is recommended.**

-------

### TO DO LIST:

* More levels
* Create Main menu
* Victory and Lost images.
* Increase performance
* Add more types of enemys and bonus.
* Better enemy movements.
  * Move according to player last position. 
  * Bosses with new moves and new ways of attacking.
  * etc...
